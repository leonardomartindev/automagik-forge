# WISH: PR Battle Royale - Multi-Agent Evaluation System

## 🎯 Objective
Create a comprehensive evaluation system to compare different coding agents and LLMs implementing the same structured tasks from the upstream migration, using consensus-based evaluation to determine winners and identify valuable features to absorb.

## 📊 Current State Analysis

### Foundation Task PRs Ready for Evaluation
1. **PR #7** - claude (migrate/upstream-foundation-b9b2) - OPEN
2. **PR #8/9** - cursor-cli-grok (forge-feat-found-a4a4) - CLOSED
3. **PR #6** - codex-medium (forge-feat-found-aafd) - OPEN
4. **PR #10** - opencode-code-supernova (forge-feat-found-21c8) - OPEN
5. **PR #12** - gemini (forge-feat-found-cf50) - OPEN

## 🤝 Consensus Workflow

### Phase 1: Individual Analysis
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Each PR] --> B[Gemini-2.5-pro Analysis]
    A --> C[Grok-4 Analysis]
    B --> D[Individual Scores]
    C --> D
```

### Phase 2: Consensus Building
```typescript
interface ConsensusRound {
  round1: {
    type: "individual_scoring"
    llms: ["gemini-2.5-pro", "grok-4"]
    output: IndividualScores[]
  }

  round2: {
    type: "discussion"
    purpose: "Align on major differences"
    output: DiscussionNotes
  }

  round3: {
    type: "final_consensus"
    output: {
      winner: string
      scores: FinalScores
      features_to_absorb: Feature[]
    }
  }
}
```

### Phase 3: Final Review
```bash
# After consensus reached
codex exec "Review PR Battle Royale results and provide executive summary"
```

## 🔧 Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Evaluation Data
```bash
# Checkout each PR branch for analysis
gh pr checkout 7  # claude
gh pr checkout 8  # cursor-cli-grok
gh pr checkout 6  # codex-medium
gh pr checkout 10 # opencode-code-supernova
gh pr checkout 12 # gemini
gh pr checkout 11 # opencode-kimi-k2
```

### Step 2: Run Consensus Evaluation
```typescript
// Using Zen consensus tool
const evaluateFoundation = async () => {
  const prs = [7, 8, 6, 10, 12, 11];

  for (const pr of prs) {
    // Round 1: Individual scoring
    const geminiScore = await agentMcp.chat({
      model: "gemini-2.5-pro",
      prompt: `Evaluate PR #${pr} against wish requirements...`
    });

    const grokScore = await agentMcp.chat({
      model: "grok-4",
      prompt: `Evaluate PR #${pr} against wish requirements...`
    });

    // Round 2: Consensus building
    const consensus = await agentMcp.consensus({
      models: ["gemini-2.5-pro", "grok-4"],
      scores: [geminiScore, grokScore],
      mode: "discussion"
    });

    // Store results
    saveEvaluation(pr, consensus);
  }
};
```

### Step 3: Determine Winner & Features
```typescript
interface WinnerSelection {
  criteria: {
    highest_total_score: number
    meets_all_requirements: boolean
    no_critical_issues: boolean
  }

  feature_absorption: {
    from_non_winners: Feature[]
    justification: string[]
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Human Validation
```yaml
human_evaluators:
  - evaluator1:
      role: "Technical Lead"
      focus: ["Architecture", "Code Quality"]
  - evaluator2:
      role: "DevOps Engineer"
      focus: ["Build System", "Safety"]
  - evaluator3:
      role: "Product Owner"
      focus: ["Requirements", "Documentation"]
```

### Step 5: Final Report Generation
```bash
# Generate comprehensive report
codex exec "
  Analyze PR Battle Royale results:
  - Winner justification
  - Features to absorb from non-winners
  - Lessons learned
  - Recommendations for next tasks
"
```

## ✅ Success Metrics
- All 6 PRs evaluated with consensus scores
- Winner selected with clear justification
